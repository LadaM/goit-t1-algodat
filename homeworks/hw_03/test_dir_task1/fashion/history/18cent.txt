18th Century: Rococo Elegance and Formality (1700s):

Female Fashion:
In the 18th century, European women's fashion was characterized by the Rococo style. Women wore elaborate gowns with wide panniers, emphasizing a voluminous silhouette. Dresses featured intricate embroidery, delicate lace, and pastel colors. High hairstyles, often adorned with feathers and ribbons, complemented the opulent attire.

Male Fashion:
Men's fashion reflected formality with three-piece suits, including knee-length breeches, waistcoats, and tailored coats. Wigs were a common accessory, and tricorn hats completed the ensemble. Fabrics were rich, and colors were often subdued, with attention to embroidery and accessories.

Highlights:

Revolutionary Garment: The chemise Ã  la reine, introduced by Marie Antoinette, was a radical departure from the structured dresses of the time. It featured a light, flowing muslin gown, symbolizing a move towards simplicity.
