19th Century: Romanticism and Victorian Elegance (1800s):

Female Fashion:
The early 19th century embraced the Romantic era, with women's fashion characterized by empire-waisted dresses, delicate fabrics, and high necklines. As the century progressed, the Victorian era brought about crinolines, corsets, and bustles, creating exaggerated hourglass figures. Rich fabrics like silk and velvet were popular, and bold colors emerged.

Male Fashion:
Men's fashion in the 19th century saw the transition from Regency styles to the more structured Victorian look. Tailcoats, waistcoats, and top hats were staples. Cravats and later neckties became popular accessories. Suits became more tailored, reflecting a more somber aesthetic.

Highlights:

Revolutionary Garment: The introduction of the cage crinoline in the mid-19th century allowed for a wider skirt without the weight of multiple petticoats, revolutionizing the silhouette.
