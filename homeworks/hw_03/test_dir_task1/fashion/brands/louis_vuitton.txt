Established in 1854, Louis Vuitton has a history of over 170 years.
In the heart of Paris, a young Louis Vuitton embarked on a journey to revolutionize travel. 
His vision led to the creation of the iconic LV monogram and Damier pattern, setting the stage for a brand synonymous with luxury luggage. 
As time unfolded, the creative baton passed to Marc Jacobs, a visionary who, from 1997 to 2013, brought modernity and innovation to the maison.
