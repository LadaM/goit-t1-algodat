Founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci, the brand has a history of more than 100 years.
In the vibrant streets of Florence, Guccio Gucci's passion for quality leather goods birthed a brand that would define Italian luxury. 
Gucci became a beacon of glamour, and under Tom Ford's creative helm from 1994 to 2004, the brand embraced sensuality and provocation, leaving an indelible mark on the fashion landscape.
