Established in 1856 by Thomas Burberry, the brand has a history of over 165 years.
On the fog-kissed streets of London, Burberry emerged as a purveyor of timeless outerwear. 
The trench coat and the iconic plaid pattern became synonymous with British style. 
Christopher Bailey, as creative director from 2001 to 2018, breathed modernity into the brand while respecting its rich heritage.
