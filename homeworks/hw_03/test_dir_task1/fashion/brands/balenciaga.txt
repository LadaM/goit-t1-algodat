Established in 1919 by Cristóbal Balenciaga, the brand has a history of over 100 years.
In the sun-drenched landscapes of Spain, Cristóbal Balenciaga shaped a brand known for avant-garde designs and daring silhouettes. His legacy paved the way for future creativity, and under Demna Gvasalia's guidance since 2015, Balenciaga has continued to push the boundaries of traditional fashion.
